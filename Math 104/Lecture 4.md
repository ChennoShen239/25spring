> If we gotta prove by definition, one important thing is that we finally want the $\left| f(x)-L \right|$ be something like $\left| x-c \right|$ so that we can then choose the **neighborhood**.

> For this theorem, the most important part is that the sequence $\implies$ limit part holds for **all** $(x_{n})\in A$ such that $\lim_{ n \to \infty }x_{n} = c$
