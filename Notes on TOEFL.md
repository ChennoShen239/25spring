- use more conjunctions
- if you use the **2 reasons version**, then you don't need to come up with a reason since there's gonna be no time for this.
- try to avoid using the same word for over 2 to 3 times.

**How to think of the reasons?**
1. my education
2. my job

e.g. Tech $\to$ education: easier for assignments $\to$ job: easier to change your job $\to$ relationship: stay in touch $\to$ health: diseases.
