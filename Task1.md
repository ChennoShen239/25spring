The reading passage and the lecture both address the outcomes of taxes on cigarettes and other unhealthy foods. Whereas the author of the passage maintains that taxing these unhealthy objects are socially beneficial, the lecture challenges this position. He casts doubt on the notion that these taxes are not going to achieve the welfare as intended but will lead to new problems.

To begin with, the author posits that levying taxes on cigarettes discourages the smoking behavior and should prevents the similar consumption of unhealthy foods. According to the article, raising taxes on them inclines these people to reduce the money spent. The lecturer, however, counters this contention. She argues that raising price due to taxes may induce the consumer to seek for those cheaper substitutes, which definitely damages their and the public health in a great sense and thereby increasing the risk. Moreover, she adduces that the same logic applies to the similar unhealthy foods.

Subsequently, the author advances the claim that levying such taxes are financially fair for the society owing to the fact that it helps reduce the inequality in social spending on medical cost relevant to these things. By contrast, the professor remains unconvinced by this claim and offers a rebuttal. She further notes that the taxing policy itself is not so fair since the income of the consumers are neglected. Consequently, the same rate of tax will lead to heavier monetary load on the low-income people which eventually casts a shadow on social equality.

Finally, the author concludes by asserting that such taxes are of importance for the government's revenue, thereby beneficial to social medical and other public welfare through more facilities and so forth. On the contrary, the professor contends  that the revenue from taxes may prevents government from doing so by the dependence of the it on the taxes, which comes in huge amounts and is of significance to the government's balance sheet. Furthermore, she remarks that the dependency may cause the government to stop approving laws that reduces the production and consumption of cigarettes and unhealthy foods for the fact that once the regulation comes true, the government itself is going to suffer from insufficient funds.
